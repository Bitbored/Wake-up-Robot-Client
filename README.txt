Wake-up robot is a schoolproject by Seppe Stas and Brecht Nuyttens.

It consists out of 2 parts: a client and a server. This Repo contains the Client part.

The client is a program written in C# that programs alarms on the server, a PIC based alarm clock robot.
This is done by a serial port, either by a bluetooth module or a USB connection.

The client can also manage the alarms and import alarms from iCal files and google agenda.

TO DO:
	-Further implement the ICAL model
	-Implement the google model
	-Redesign the vieuws
